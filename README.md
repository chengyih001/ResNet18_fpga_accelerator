# Abstract

***This is my final year thesis supervised under Professor Wei ZHANG, HKUST. More details regarding this thesis can be found in the research report under [Hardware Acceleration for AI](https://github.com/chengyih001/ResNet18_fpga_accelerator/blob/main/Hardware%20Acceleration%20for%20AI%Processing.pdf)***

This repository is all the source code of my customized ResNet18 accelerator implementation on FPGA devices. All of the testing are done are AWS FPGA Developer F1 instances.
